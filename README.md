# VibeWords ✨

**Thematic vocabulary generator for fiction writers**

Writers don't need synonyms - they need *vibes*. 

A thesaurus tells you "walked" = "strolled". VibeWords tells you that a heist scene needs words like *infiltrate*, *adrenaline*, *vault*, *ticking clock*, and *chess game*.

## Why

Found this tweet: *"I wish there was a tool where you could input a theme and related words come out. Like input: heist, and every relevant word would come up - actions, objects, emotions, atmosphere."*

No good tool exists. Now it does.

## Features

- 🎭 **8 curated themes** - Heist, Romance, Horror, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Noir, Action, Cozy
- ⚡ **5 word categories** - Actions, Emotions, Objects, Atmosphere, Metaphors
- 🎲 **Randomized selection** - Hit generate for fresh combinations
- 📋 **Click to copy** - One click copies word to clipboard
- 🌙 **Dark theme** - Easy on the eyes during late-night writing sessions

## Run Locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step, no dependencies.

```bash
cd playground/vibewords
open index.html  # macOS

```

Or use a local server:
